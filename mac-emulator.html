      I have a passion for presenting, and I thought it would be fun to revisit
      one of the earliest Mac experiences I had with presentations. I found
      this emulator online and paired it with a graphic originally used by a
      colleague from the now-retired "Modern Slide" site. The site may be gone,
      but the image lives on. Enjoy!
