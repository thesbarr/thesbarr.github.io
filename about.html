        <p class="intro-text">
          Hi, I’m <strong>Stephen Barr, Ed.D</strong>. I work in higher education, helping VCU run smarter, more student-focused operations in auxiliary services. I’ve spent most of my career behind the scenes making sure things work well for students, whether that’s launching a new retail partnership or improving dining options to better fit real student needs.
        </p>
        <p class="intro-text">
          What I love most is solving problems...big ones, small ones, the kind that don’t come with a clear playbook. I’m always thinking about how to make things more efficient, more meaningful, and ultimately more human. I believe students should feel like they’re part of a thoughtful, well-run campus that meets them where they are.
        </p>
        <p class="intro-text">
          When I’m not behind the desk, you’ll often find me roaming campus sampling the next great VCU spot, soaking up student life, and sketching out my next idea.
          Once I leave campus, my side gig as chauffeur-dad kicks in: ferrying the kids to soccer practice, matches, or wherever the day takes us.
        </p>
        <p class="intro-text">
          Thanks for stopping by!
